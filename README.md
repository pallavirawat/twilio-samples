It reads contacts from a contact file. There is a template present. The application will send messages to all the contacts mentioned in contacts.json which you will have to create. It is not there in repo for obvious reasons.

Set env variables:
```
ACCOUNT_SID
AUTH_TOKEN
FROM_NO
````

`AUTH_TOKEN=<>;ACCOUNT_SID=<>;FROM_NO=<>`
